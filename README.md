📝 Summary
This project implements machine learning methodologies to predict domestic energy consumption patterns across England and Wales at the postcode level. The implementation includes:

Automated machine learning pipeline for model selection and optimization
Feature importance analysis to identify key predictors of energy consumption
Global sensitivity analysis using Sobol sequences
Comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering pipeline
Scalable methods for national-level predictions at neighborhood granularity

The codebase is structured to support reproducible research and can be extended for similar prediction tasks in other geographical contexts.
